# 👋 Hi, I'm Edson Alexis Cruz Carballo

## 💻 Backend / Full‑Stack Web Developer

I'm a **backend web developer** with experience in **Node.js, Django, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL**, and a solid foundation in **frontend** (React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I focus on building well-structured, maintainable applications aligned with **good architectural practices**.

Currently looking to grow as a developer, diving deeper into **clean architectures**, **performance optimization**, **data analysis**, and **advanced backend**, with special interest in **Rust** for the future.
